Race1 and Race2 files are basically two programs who have to face a race condition to either open or create the output.txt file so therefore output is unpredictable.
The process according to thier priority are given CPU it can even face race condition for writing or opening on a file so even in that case they have unpredictable output
To run 2 Programs simultaneously in  Linux we create a script run.sh and run both in multiproccessing environment in linux
To counter this race condition we need Atomicity
Atomicity is a condition in which the code is written in such a way that code cannot be run by other procees/thread 'AT THE SAME TIME' while it is being executed/run by first process/thread.All system calls in linux are executed atomically.
Process is an instance of an executing or running program.
Source code is first converted into an object file using COMPILER and ASSEMBLER and then is linked with libraries to form an executable file with the help of a LINKER(COFF/ELF) and loaded into the memory using a LOADER.
